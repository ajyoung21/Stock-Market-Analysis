Analyzing Stock Market Data

The screenshots are parts of my Excel file that I had to submit for a class. Looking at any one of them
will show you the report that I generated.

To best understand my coding analysis, I would recommend looking at the VBA script (located in Module 9) and running
it on the alphabetical_testing file to see the summary report it creates. The Multiple_Year_Stock_Data file works slightly
better (as I had to tweak the code when transitioning over to the real data), yet it is a large file and
likely not worth your time to download.
